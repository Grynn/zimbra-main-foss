NOTE: Currently on main you can switch to jetty by setting env variable ZIMBRA_USE_JETTY=1.  If not set, everything will still use tomcat.  This will change when we move away from tomcat.  At this point jetty support is only experimental and only 4 projects have been tested: ZimbraServer, ZimbraWebClient, ZimbraSync and ZimbraOffline.  So far jetty has only been test on Mac OS X but should also work on Linux and Windows+cygwin.

1. Download jetty 6.1.  As of writing it's jetty-6.1.0rc3.zip.
2. Unzip to /opt/zimbra/jetty-6.1.0rc3 and symlink 'ln -s /opt/zimbra/jetty-6.1.0rc3 /opt/zimbra/jetty'.
3. Download slf4j (Simple Logging Facade for Java to replace Log4J).  As of writing it's slf4j-1.1.0.tar.gz.  Extra three jar files, jcl104-over-slf4j-1.1.0.jar, slf4j-simple-1.1.0.jar and slf4j-api-1.1.0.jar and put them in /opt/zimbra/jetty/lib.
4. Set env variable ZIMBRA_USE_JETTY=1.  You also need to set env var JAVA_HOME to the right place.  On Mac OS X it should be /System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Home.
5. Run 'ant reset-the-world' under ZimbraServer. Then run 'ant deploy' and 'ant admin-deploy' under ZimbraSync as usual.  For offline, run 'ant offline-reset-the-world'.
6. You should also be able to bounce jetty with command line 'jetty start' and 'jetty stop' because reset-the-world copies a script 'jetty' to /opt/zimbra/bin. 

Debugging in Eclipse (there are more than one way and this is not necessarily the best):

1. Go to http://docs.codehaus.org/display/JETTY/Jetty+Documentation and click on "Importing Jetty Source into Eclipse".  Follow the instructions to download and install/run maven.  Import at least the "start" project into eclipse.
2. Don't follow the instructions in "Debugging Jetty with Eclipse" under jetty docs (at least it didn't work for me).  Instead, setup a debug configuration in eclipse for the "start" project.  Note that under project "start" the org.mortbay.start.Main is the main class when you launch "java -jar start.jar".  Anyway, follow the following steps to set it up.
3. Run/Debug... and right click on Java Application to "New" a configuration.
4. Choose project "start" and set the main class to be org.mortbay.start.Main.
5. Switch to the Arguments tab and set VM arguments to "-DSTART=/opt/zimbra/jetty/etc/start.config -DSTOP.PORT=7867 -DSTOP.KEY=stop -Dzimbra.config=/opt/zimbra/conf/localconfig.xml -Djava.library.path=/opt/zimbra/lib".  Then choose "Other" under working directory and set it to /opt/zimbra/jetty-6.1.0rc3.
6. Now switch to source tab and add some zimbra projects to the list.  That allows you to set break points in your zimbra project source files.
7. Save the debug configuration and click Debug.  If everything goes well, you should be able to stop in your source code with break points.
8. To stop jetty you can do this on command line "java -DSTOP.PORT=7867 -DSTOP.KEY=stop -jar start.jar --stop".  Or you could run the "stop-jetty-java" target under ZimbraServer.

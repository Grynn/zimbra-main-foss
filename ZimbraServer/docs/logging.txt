Catagories
------------------------------------------------------------
We are switching the log4j catagory naming convention from a strict physical 
classname-based naming convention to a combo. Subsytems will be grouped
and named logically, all under the "liquid" name. 

For example, the following catagories will be pre-defined:

liquid.misc
liquid.pop
liquid.imap
liquid.index
liquid.journal
liquid.lmtp
liquid.mailbox
liquid.account
liquid.replication
liquid.security
liquid.soap

NOTE: The "liquid.*" loggers are strictly for messages that are for 
Operator-Important messages...Where "operator" means the person who
runs the software in the field. The messages must make sense to 
someone who doesn't know the details of the system.

The liquid.* DEBUG level is for (extra information for OPERATORS to
enable if they are trying to debug. E.G. Might trace the individual
steps in an operation ("creating DB entry...creating LDAP entry....
creating Index") in a way that helps the operator diagnose a problem.

You should use the most-specific catagory available. If none apply (and
you aren't creating a major new subsytem), then use the "liquid.misc" catagory.

We should continue to use the classname itself when we want to enable
fine-grained debugging/tracing of a subsystem/class.

------------------------------------------------------------
Defaults
------------------------------------------------------------
By default, eveything under "liquid.*" will be configured to log at the 
following levels:

INFO/WARN/ERROR/FATAL

Everything under com.liquidsys.* will be turned off by default.

Anything logged at FATAL will cause an SNMP trap. It may turn out admins 
also want to trap errors, as they can be indicative of a larger problem.

Anything logged at FATAL/ERROR will be sent to syslog. We might also decide
to send all WARNs to syslog as well.

------------------------------------------------------------
Guide to Log Levels
------------------------------------------------------------

FATAL   The FATAL level designates very severe error events that will 
        presumably lead the application to abort, or have impact on a large
        number of users. For example, being unable to contact the mysql
        database.

ERROR   The ERROR level designates error events that might still allow 
        the application to continue running, or impact a single user. 
        For example, a single mailbox having a corrupt index, or being
        unable to delete a message from a mailbox.

WARN    The WARN level designates potentially harmful situations, but are
        usually recoverable or can be ignored. For example, using a default
        value (baked into source code) when expected config data isn't found.

INFO    The INFO level designates informational messages that highlight the
        progress of the application at coarse-grained level. For example,
        server start-up, mailbox creation/deletion, account creation. You
        would generally not want to log something at info if it happens on
        every single request. If we need that type of logging (i.e., each
        operation for auditing), then we should create a catagory, like 
        "liquid.mailbox.op", and have logging for it set to OFF by default.

DEBUG   Events that would generally be useful to help a customer and/or 
        support debug problems at a customer site. For example, logging
        all parameters in a command, logging each request, etc. To enable
        even more fine-grained logging, we should use the classname itself
        as the catagory, and enable debugging on the class.


------------------------------------------------------------
Making logging calls in code
------------------------------------------------------------
All loggers will be defined as public static members on the following
class:

package com.liquidsys.coco.util;

public class LiquidLog {
  public Log misc; // "liquid.misc";
  public Log index; // "liquid.index";
  // etc
}

So, to log an error in your code under the liquid.mailbox catagory, you'd
use:

LiquidLog.mailbox.error("...");

If you are doing debug logging and/or or it is very expensive to compute your
log string, then you will generally want to make sure that level is enabled
before constucting the string:

if (LiquidLog.index.isDebugEnabled())
  LiquidLog.index.debug(foo+" "+bar);

If you are logging something to the liquid.* catagories at 
INFO/WARN/ERROR/CRITICAL you probably don't need to check.

If there are cases where you want extra levels of debugging/information,
then you can use the classname-based catagory naming. 

For example:

    private static Log mLog = LogFactory.getLog(Mailbox.class);
    ...
    LiquidLog.mailbox.info("mailbox created...");
    ...
    if (LiquidLog.mailbox.isDebugEnabled()) 
      LiquidLog.mailbox.debug("coarse-grained debug info...");
    ...
    if (mLog.isDebugEnabled()) {
       // lots and lots of debugging spew
       mLog.debug("...");
    }

Now if someone needs to really debug a particular class, they can enable
DEBUG for "log4j.logger.com.liquidsys.coco.mailbox.Mailbox".

NOTE: The class was called LiquidLog because the Liquid class is used
for another purpose, and there are a billion Log classes already.

------------------------------------------------------------
Nested Diagnostic Context
------------------------------------------------------------
The logging format has been modifed to include [%x] in the output, which 
instructs log4j to log the NDC. If one is not set, then [] is output.

From the log4j NDC javadoc:

"A Nested Diagnostic Context, or NDC in short, is an instrument to distinguish
interleaved log output from different sources. Log output is typically
interleaved when a server handles multiple clients near-simultaneously.

Interleaved log output can still be meaningful if each log entry from 
different contexts had a distinctive stamp. This is where NDCs come into play."

SoapEngine.java has been modified to set/clear the NDC at the beginning/end
of a request. In particular, it sets the NDC to this:

ip={request-ip-address};name={account-name}[;aname={authtoken-account-name}]

where "name" is the account name (i.e., the account id the request
is operating on). "aname" is only present if the authtoken id is different
then the "id" (i.e., an admin is doing an operation on an account).

If the account lookups fail for whatever reason, only the UUIDs will be logged, as "id" and "aid".

For example:

2005-01-25 16:52:17,763 DEBUG [http-7070-Processor4] [ip=192.168.1.10;name=user1@liquidsys.com] SoapEngine - dispatch: doc GetMsgRequest

Additionally, if the DocumentHandler.getRequestedMailbox method is called,
then the NDC is modified to also include "mid={mailbox-id}". By convention,
this method is called at the start of any requests that operate on a mailbox.
We might just want to have mailbox/index-related methods log the mailbox
id themselves though.

Moving forward, we'll need to make sure that the NDC is set correctly for
all entry points (content servlet, pop, imap).

REQUIREMENTS
============
When sharing calendars, folders, etc, it becomes a burden to grant access by 
accounts only. You should be able to grant access to a whole group of users. 

Instead of adding a new named entity to the system (i.e., "groups"), we decided
to leverage the existing distribution list (DL) infrastructure and enable DLs
to be used as groups.

This has a number of benefits:

  - get to re-use the existing DL infrastructure, including all the admin UI
    support.
  
  - users (admin and end-users) don't have to learn two different concepts,
    they just know and understand a single concept, which is a named group
    of users that they can send mail to and/or use in ACLs.
    
  - admins don't have to maintain two parallel lists of users. i.e., they 
    don't need to maintain the "engineering group" and the "engineering DL".
  
  - group discovery can be done via the GAL
  
  - groups can contain other groups

IMPLEMENTATION
==============
What makes a distribution list a group?
---------------------------------------

A distribution list is a group if it has the object class "zimbraSecurityGroup"
listed in its object classes. Mixing in this auxiliary object class changes the
behavior of the provisioning code with respect to distribution lists, and also
allows distribution lists themselves to members of other groups.

Adding this object class to a distribution list changes the behavior of 
provisioning code in the following ways:

  1) when adding a member to a DL that ia security group:

     add the DL's zimbraId to the member's zimbraMemberOf attr
   
  2) when removing a member from a DL that is a security group:

     remove the DL's zimbraId from the member's zimbraMemberOf attr
     
  3) when deleting a DL that is a group:

     for each member in the DL that is local to Zimbra, update their 
     zimbraMemberOf attr by removing the DL's

What makes a user a member of a group?
--------------------------------------
A user is a member of a group if their LDAP entry has a "zimbraMemberOf" attr
that is set to the zimbraId of the DL/group.

Example
-------
Normally, a user is a member of DL if their primary email address or any of
their aliases is present in the DL's zimbraMailForwardingAddress attr.

For example, if you add "user1@g5.local" to the "users@g5.local" DL, the
DL's LDAP attrs would look like:

# distributionList users@g5.local memberCount=1
mail: users@g5.local
objectClass: zimbraDistributionList
objectClass: zimbraMailRecipient
uid: users
zimbraId: a5e95d80-2531-4708-b406-8b736443b202
zimbraMailAlias: users@g5.local
zimbraMailForwardingAddress: user1@g5.local
zimbraMailStatus: enabled

Postfix uses the zibraMailForwardingAddress to route all mail for the DL to the
members.

If you looked at user1's LDAP entry, there would be no indication that it is a
member of the "users@g5.local" DL. If we allow "users@g5.local" to be a group
and look at the DL entry again, we'd see one difference:

# distributionList users@g5.local memberCount=1
mail: users@g5.local
objectClass: zimbraDistributionList
objectClass: zimbraMailRecipient
objectClass: zimbraSecurityGroup
uid: users
zimbraId: a5e95d80-2531-4708-b406-8b736443b202
zimbraMailAlias: users@g5.local
zimbraMailForwardingAddress: user1@g5.local
zimbraMailStatus: enabled

The only difference is the presence of the "zimbraSecurityGroup" objectClass
attr. But now, if we look at user1's LDAP entry, we'd see a "zimbraMemberOf"
attribute:

# name user1@g5.local
cn: Demo User One
displayName: Demo User One
mail: user1@g5.local
mail: user.one@g5.local
objectClass: organizationalPerson
objectClass: zimbraAccount
objectClass: amavisAccount
...
zimbraMemberOf: a5e95d80-2531-4708-b406-8b736443b202
....

If you compare the value of the zimbraMemberOf attr with the zimbraId of the DL,
you'll see they are the same. If the DL is delete and/or the user is removed
from the DL, then this attr will be removed from the user's entry.

GROUPS OF GROUPS
================
DLs can contain other DLs, and thus groups can contain other groups. If a user
is in DL A, and DL A is also in DL B, then the user will be in both groups. For
example, lets consider the case where all@g5.local and engineering@g5.local are both
DLs that are groups, and engineering is a mmeber of "all".

If we look at "all@g5.local", we see that it has one member, engineering@g5.local:

# distributionList all@g5.local memberCount=1
mail: all@g5.local
objectClass: zimbraDistributionList
objectClass: zimbraMailRecipient
objectClass: zimbraSecurityGroup
uid: all
zimbraId: 6f29b614-2017-4ae6-8ba0-e18ac697033b
zimbraMailAlias: all@g5.local
zimbraMailForwardingAddress: engineering@g5.local
zimbraMailStatus: enabled

If we look at engineering@g5.local, we see that is has one member, user1@g5.local:

# distributionList engineering@g5.local memberCount=1
mail: engineering@g5.local
objectClass: zimbraDistributionList
objectClass: zimbraMailRecipient
objectClass: zimbraSecurityGroup
uid: engineering
zimbraId: d498dfa5-3f5c-478f-aa8d-895caf66ffda
zimbraMailAlias: engineering@g5.local
zimbraMailForwardingAddress: user1@g5.local
zimbraMailStatus: enabled
zimbraMemberOf: 6f29b614-2017-4ae6-8ba0-e18ac697033b

But you'll also noticate that it also has a "zimbraMemberOf" attr, that indicates itself 
is a member of another group.

If we look at user1's entry however, it only has a single zimbraMemberOf attr:

zimbraMemberOf: d498dfa5-3f5c-478f-aa8d-895caf66ffda

It indicates that it is a member of only the engineering@g5.local group. Is the user
also a member of the all@g5.local group, the answer is yes, and we'll see why.

CALCULATING A USER'S GROUP MEMBERSHIP LIST
==========================================
When calculating all the groups a user belongs to, we don't just stop at all the
"zimbraMemberOf" ids. If we did, then user1 wouldn't be a member of the all@g5.local group,
even thogh logically they should be. We could try and maintain the zimbraMemberOf attr
for all groups a user logically belongs to, but that would quite expensive to maintain
in realtime. The fanout problem becomes fairly big when you have nested groups of groups.
Adding one group to another could potentially update thousands or tens of thousands of entries.

In order to calculate all groups a user belongs to, we need to not only include all
groups listed in their zimbraMemberOf ids, we also need to include all groups listed
in those group's zimbraMemberOf ids, and so on.

This algorithm is actually fairly trivial to implement, and is described (implemented 
slighly differently) here:

http://middleware.internet2.edu/dir/groups/rpr-nmi-edit-mace_dir-groups_best_practices-1.0.html

The algorithm is:

Step 1: Initialize the set "groups" to the empty set. When we are done, this set will
        contain all groups the user belongs to.

Step 2: Add all groups listed directly in the user's zimbraMemberOf attrs to the 
        "groupsToCheck" set.
        
Step 3: while group in  "groupsToCheck":
            add group to "groups", remove from groupsToCheck
            lookup group (potentially in the server's cache already)
            if the group is a member of another group AND
                group isn't alread in "groups", add it to "groupsToCheck" # prevents cycles
            end
        end

If we apply this algorithm to our example above, you'd have:

groups: {}
groupsToCheck: {d498dfa5-3f5c-478f-aa8d-895caf66ffda}

After checking the group, we'd see that it is a meber of a group, and we'd then have:

groups: {d498dfa5-3f5c-478f-aa8d-895caf66ffda}
groupsToCheck: {6f29b614-2017-4ae6-8ba0-e18ac697033b}

We'd then see that the all@g5.local group isn't a member of any other groups and end
up with:

groups: {d498dfa5-3f5c-478f-aa8d-895caf66ffda, 
         6f29b614-2017-4ae6-8ba0-e18ac697033b}
groupsToCheck: {}

And we'd stop with user1 belonging to two groups.

NOTE: We also will most likely treat the domain the user belongs to as an "implicit" group,
      and add its zimbraId to the list of "groups" a user belongs to.


TURNING A DL GROUP capability on/off
=======================

When enabling a DL as a group there are three things that need to be done:

  1. add the zimbraSecurityGroup object class to the DL

  2. update the DL's zimbraMemberOf attr for each DL it is in that is also a group.

  3. for all members in the DL local to Zimbra, update their zimbraMemberOf attr

When disabling a DL as a group:

  1. remove zimbraSecurityGroup object class and all zibraMemberOf attrs 

  2. for all members in the DL local to Zimbra, update their zimbraMemberOf attr


SOAP Changes
============

Get DL now returns whether or not a a distribution list a security group:

   <dl name="{name}" id="{id}"  isgroup="0|1" >
  
  
{Create/Modify}DistributionList now allows a DL's ability to be used as a group to be turned
on/off via a new element:

   <isgroup>0|1</isgroup>
   
ZMPROV CHANGES
==============

zmprov has a new command to turn on/off group status for a DL:

    DistributionListIsGroup(dlig) {list@domain|id} 0|1
    
NOTES
=======================

Remote Users
------------
Only local users (a user that Zimbra is authoritative for) get access rights when
added to a DL that is a group. For example, adding joe.random@yahoo.com a DL that
is a group only causes mail to be sent to that user, it doesn't grant them access.

In the future, it will be possible for two Zimbra installations to set up a trust
relationship, in which case adding a remote user from one of those domains could actually
grant access to local resources.

One could also imagine a scenario where adding a remote user to a DL that is a group mails
said user some information that the user can use to remotely access protected data.

Be careful when adding people to a DL that is a group
------------------------------------------------------  
There might be cases where a DL is used as a mailing list and a group, and
someone needs to be added to the mailing list *only*. 
    
There are at least two solutions:
     
    a) have two DLs, and make one of them a DL only and add the other (which is also a group)
       to it. For example:
    
         engineering: engineering-group, joe.random
         engineering-group: (all the users who get granted accees to engineering resources)
         
       engineering is a DL-only, engineering-group is a DL+group.
         
   2) Aonther alternative way would be something like:
   
         engineering: (all the users who get granted access to engineering resouces), engineering-info
         engineering-info: joe.random
         
   engineering is a DL+group, engineering-info a DL-only. Since engineering-info is a DL-only, any users
   in engineering-info will not be a member of the group "engineering".
   
   I'd lean towards (1), with a suggestion of naming all DLs that can be used a security groups "{something}-group". 
   That way there is less confusion over whether a DL is also a group.
   
----------------------------------

TODO:

add new provutil and/or soap call to get all DLs that a DL and/or account belongs to. This can
already be done with SearchAccounts (ask for only DLs that contain zimbraMailForwardingAddress to
all the email addresses for an account (primary name, any aliases), so this call is techinically not needed
but would be nice to have.

Would also be nice to have the admin console show all DLs/groups a user belongs to when pulling up the user.

----------------------------------

issues:

- privacy. need to be able to make DL/group membership private, this will probably require
           postfix to auth. This is for HIPPA/FERPA compliance.

- should be possible to a hide a DL/group from a the GAL

- user-created groups/DLs would be nice a feature. Maybe a requirement that they be prefixed with
 the user's primary email address followed by a "-". 

- ACLs on groups/DLs

- well known groups - could use WKGs for fine-grained access control (i.e., zimbra-account-read group
  membership could allow its members read access to accounts in the admin console).

- probably need the ability to make it so you can't mail to a DL and just use it as a group. 
  I think setting the zimbraMailStatus to "disable" is all that is needed to achieve this, 
  need to verify.

Notes on snmp support.

	Traps only - there is no support for snmp queries, since there is no
	MIB for the product as yet.

Liquid OID:
	Enterprise number for liquid TBD.

MIB Objects:
	lqStatus := liquid.1
	lqServiceName := lqStatus.0 (String)
	lqServiceStatus := lqStatus.1 (Int)
		0 for down, 1 for up.

Traps supported:
	lqtraps := liquid.0
	lqServiceStatusTrap := lqtraps.0
		Includes an lqStatus object.

When snmp is configured to run, traps will be generated every 
time the status of a service changes.

Snmp configuration:
	- install the liquid-snmp package.
	- run the createsnmp script, provide requested information (trap host)
	- start services (lqcontrol startup)

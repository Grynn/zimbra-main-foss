Mailbox move transfers an account's mailbox from one mailhost to
another.

On Linux, run lqmailboxmove to see the usage. You need to

- know the admin username and password on the source host
- make sure both source and target hosts have been provisioned
in the LDAP directory
- the mailbox to be moved does not exist on the target host

Examples:

lqmailboxmove -s ashcroft -t kchenlaptop -a kchen@ashcroft.liquidsys.com

copies the mailbox of account "kchen@ashcroft.liquidsys.com" from host ashcroft to kchenlaptop.


lqmailboxmove -sw -s ashcroft -t kchenlaptop -a kchen@ashcroft.liquidsys.com

does the same thing. Additionally by specifying -s (switch over), the LDAP directory is updated 
so that further email messages will be delivered to the target host.


Note on testing:

You can move your real emails from dogfood to your own laptop:

(1) add your laptop hostname to LDAP (run lqprov and use 'cs' and 'gas' commands on dogfood)
(2) modify your conf/localconfig.xml, and point ldap_host to the LDAP server used by
    the source host (in this case, dogfood). Add liquid_server_hostname to point to your
    laptop.
(3) update ldap_root_password and liquid_ldap_password to those set on the source host
    (usually 'liquid'/'liquid' on dogfood)
(4) restart tomcat on your laptop
(5) for windows, do:
      java com.liquidsys.coco.mailbox.MailboxMoveUtil 
        -a <you>@dogfood.liquidsys.com -s dogfood  -t <yourlaptop>
    for linux, use lqmailboxmove script
(5) sometimes the laptop hostname doesn't work. Use your laptop's IP address.
(6) if you need to move the mailbox again, you need to specify -ow option to 
overwrite the existing mailbox on the target host.

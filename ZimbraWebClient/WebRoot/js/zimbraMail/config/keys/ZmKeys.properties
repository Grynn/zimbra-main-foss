# Keyboard Shortcuts for the ZCS Web Client
#
#
# There are three parts to each property below. The first two are the name
# of a map and an action, and they are combined with a period to form the
# property name. The property's value is a key sequence. For example:
#
#    compose.Send = Alt+S
#
# Maps
# ----
#
# The map names in this properties file refer to views within the ZCS web 
# client. The map name is the first part of the property name and
# comes before the period. The following are valid map names:
#
#    global					applies to all views
#    compose				a form for creating a new message
#    mail					a list of mail messages or conversations
#    conversation			a list of mail messages, with the content of the
#							selected message displayed in the lower pane
#    message				the content of a single mail message; only used
#							by message list view with reading pane off
#    contacts				a set of contacts in either list or cards view
#    editContact			a form for creating or editing a contact
#    calendar				any of several calendar views (week, month, etc)
#    editAppointment		a form for creating or editing an appointment
#    options				a set of tabs for changing settings
#    mixed					a view of different types of items (eg Trash)
#    notebook				the wiki application
#
# Actions
# -------
#
# An action is an event triggered by a shortcut. It is what the shortcut
# does. Most of the time, the action invoked by a web client shortcut emulates
# something that could have been done using the mouse, for example clicking
# on a particular button. To see what actions are available and what each action does,
# check the documentation section below. 
#
# The following actions are available:
#
#
# The action "INHERIT" has special meaning. When it is used, the name of a
# map is given rather than a key sequence. The current map will copy all the
# shortcuts of the given map, and then may add or override those shortcuts.
# In general, you probably do not want to change those properties.
#
# To define a shortcut that applies only on a particular platform (Windows,
# Macintosh, or Linux), add a platform identifier to the action. The platform
# identifier can be one of:
#
#    win mac linux
#
# For example:
#
#    compose.Send.mac = Ctrl+Enter
#    
# Key Sequences (shortcuts)
# -------------
#
# A key sequence is a set of one or more keys that triggers an action. Each
# key in the sequence may have a modifier (such as the Control or Shift key).
# Most key sequences consist of just one key. The keys in multiple-key
# sequences are separated with a comma. The next key in a sequence must be
# struck within a short time for the sequence to continue.
#
# The following are valid modifiers:
#
#    Ctrl Meta Alt Shift
#
# To add a modifier to a key, specify the modifier, then a plus sign, then the
# key. For example: Ctrl+C. If you want to add more than one modifier, use
# another plus sign. For example: Ctrl+Alt+Del.
#
# If you want to have more than one shortcut for the same action, use a 
# semicolon (and optional space) to separate the shortcuts. For example, to
# specify three shortcuts for list action Foo:
#
#     list.Foo 		= A; B; C 
# 
# Key sequences have no notion of upper case or lower case. They map to what
# you see on your keyboard (for example, a "T"), rather than the character it
# produces when you strike it (a "t"). To specify a keystroke that requires the
# Shift key, you must use the Shift modifier. For example, to specify the "@"
# key, you'd use: Shift+2.
#
# Each letter, number, and non-shifted printable character represents itself:
#
#    A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
#    ` - = [ ] ; ' , . /
#
# Non-printable keys are specified with special names. The following special
# keys are available:
#
#    Home End Esc Del Backspace Enter ArrowUp ArrowDown ArrowLeft ArrowRight
#    Space Comma Backslash Semicolon
#
# The sequence "NNN" has a special meaning in shortcuts. It stands for "any
# number". For example, with the mapping
#
#    mail.MoveToFolder = M,NNN
#
# the key sequence "M,3" will move selected messages to the folder which has
# 3 as its alias. Only actions which contain "NNN" support that sort of mapping.

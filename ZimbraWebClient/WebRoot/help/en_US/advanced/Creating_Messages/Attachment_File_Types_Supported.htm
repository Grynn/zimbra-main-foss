<h1>Attachment file types supported</h1>
<p>You can attach any file on your file system that you can find using 
 the browse button.</p>
<p>You can open any file attachment directly from the Zimbra Web Client, 
 provided that your workstation has the right application and the extension 
 is not blocked by your system administrator. &nbsp;For 
 example, to open a document created using Microsoft Word, you need to 
 be able to run Microsoft Word on your computer.</p>
<p>On most computers, the file type is indicated by the extension, which 
 is usually a period followed by a three-letter code. Examples could include 
 files such as <span style="font-weight: bold;"><B>expenses.xls</B></span> 
 or<span style="font-weight: bold;"><B> New-Items.doc</B></span>. 
 If the file type is one that is supported by the installed software on 
 your computer, you can typically double-click the file and your computer 
 will automatically launch the right application for reading that file.</p>
<p>Many types of files can be opened directly from your browser using various 
 plug-ins. Usually, if you click a file link on a page, your browser automatically 
 detects whether or not you have the right plug-in, and prompts you to 
 download it. Note that your system administration policies may not permit 
 end users to download and install any sort of software.</p>
<ul><li style="margin-left: -20px;" class=p-note><p class=note style="font-weight: bold;">Notes:<span 
 style="font-weight: normal;"> <br>
	On Windows computers, the computer assumes that the file type in the 
 filename matches the actual format. Even if the file is correctly formatted 
 internally, if it does not have the right file type extension in the filename, 
 your computer may not be able to recognize it and open the right application 
 for you.</span><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br>
	<br>
	An increasing number of computer viruses have been designed to spread 
 via file attachments. Therefore, in some environments, system administrators 
 have opted to block incoming mail containing certain types of attachments, 
 most notably files with the extension .EXE or .ZIP 
 as part of their filename. If you send an email message to someone whose 
 email system has been configured to block certain types of attachments, 
 you may or may not receive any notification that was blocked.</span></p></li>

This source code forked out of the iCal4j CVS tree immediately post 0.9.16

Three changes have been made:

1) net.fortuna.ical4j.model.TimeZone has been replaced with a new
   implementation based on SimpleTimeZone.  This was done because of
   signifcant performance problems encountered with the iCal4j
   version.  The iCal4j TimeZone class expands the Daylight and
   Standard rules over a huge range (1601-present) on every call to
   inDaylight.

2) Uris.java: commented out the code in Uris.encode() and
   Uris.decode() because the Uri-encoding was causing problems with
   java.net.URL building (specifically we would end up with URL's
   where the SchemeSpecificPart was "MAILTO%3Afoo%40bar.com".  This
   was done this way (via URIs.java) so as to minimize the amount of
   iCal4j code changed.

3) net.fortuna.ical4j.data.UnfoldingReader has been changed to use
   relaxed mode by default.  This allows .ics data with folded lines
   generated by some systems (e.g. Evolution) to be parsed correctly
   even though they use bare LF linebreads rather than CRLF as required
   by RFC2445.

4) Parse iCalendar objects containing multiple ZCALENDAR sections.
